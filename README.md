***TIME TO CODE!!!!!***

This is Where all my challenges in ops from codefellows will be kept (for 201 at least)

This Repo is for my continued growth as a coder and cybersecurity specialist. It will contain useful scripts i make and Scripts that are just for learning. As I grow (so will this document) I will be creating a new repo for some test scripts(just to break things).

Some of the fundamental concepts from ops 201 would be Functions, Variables, 
loops, Bash, and powershell.

So I really liked the idea behind the shell scripting we did, it seems (to me anyway) that is a way to build plug and play scripts that can be versitilly used to find and solve other issues.

Oh I will be improving my 07 script and my 13LabTest just as soon as i have the time to.

Personally I am really looking forward to improving my speed and comprehension in my scripting skillset.
