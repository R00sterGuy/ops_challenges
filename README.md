All my challenges in ops from codefellows
HEY YOU GUYS!!!!!
This Repo is for my continued growth as a coder and cybersecurity specialist.
some of the fundamental concepts from ops 201 would be Functions, Variables, loops, Bash, and powershell.
So I really liked the idea behind the shell scripting we did, it seems (to me anyway) that is is a way to build plug and play scripts that can be versitilly used to find and solve other issues.
Oh I will be improving my 07 script and my 13LabTest.
I am really looking forward to improving my speed and comprehension in my scripting skillset.
